Formula One (also known as  F1) is the highest class of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
I present a descriptve Analysis on formula 1 races to identify strong patterns regarding drivers and constructors over past years. <br>
**Goal - To Understand Insights from past races** <br>
**Skills - EDA** <br>
**Libraries - Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib** <br>

# Terminologies
* Constructor - Constructors are basically teams in F1, Each season has 10 competing constructors. Each constructor has 2 drivers assigned to it. 
* Constructors build their own cars to race each season under FIA Norms <br>
* Pit Stops - For each race the Formula 1 car is allowed to change tyres and modify certain elements using pit stops. The Pit stop timings does affect race. <br>
* Qualifying - There are 3 Qualifying races Q1, Q2 and Q3. Lap times of Qualifying race decides the starting grid(Starting position for each race) of the race <br>
* Pole - The first position in the Grid is called pole

Aim of the project is to answer the following questions based on past Data

**Data** 
* circuits - Circuits where F1 races are held
* Constructor_Results - Race results of the constructor's championship
* Constructors_Standing Final standings of the constructor's championship
* Constructors - Constructors in F1
* Driver Standing - Final standings of the driver's championship
* Drivers - Drivers in F1
* Lap times - Lap times in F1
* Pit stops - Pit stops timings in F1
* Qualifying - Qualifying results in F1
* Races Races in F1
* Results - Results of all F1 races
* Seasons - Season wise description F1
Mapping of various statuses <br>
Identifiers are presents in circuits.csv, driver.csv, constructors.csv , Races.csv and Status.csv where we can identify the circuit, driver, constructor, races and status using their unique ids <br>

**Circuit Analysis -**

To find the distribution of formula 1 circuits over different countries


**Formula 1 Race Analysis-**

To indentify top drivers and constructors on the basis of points and no of different position attained

To identify the rise/fall of a constructor based on time in History

To find pattern in no of races based on time over period of years

To identify the pattern in Nationality and drivers over period of years

To identify the age pattern in drivers over time as well as age pattern based on constructor

Identify the pattern in mean age over period of years

Identify drivers with maximum number of fastest laps


**Scorecards**

Making the Position dashboard for drivers and constructos based on each year

Geting info about a driver based on search
